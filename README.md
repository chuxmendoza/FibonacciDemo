# Fibonachi_node
Fibonacci Node.js
I decided to use node as execution environment for javascript, this due to my experience working with the Netsuite framework
This is the example link
http://localhost:8081/fibonacci?num=6
I am sending a parameter from the url which will be used for the getResult function which will return the result in fibonacci
parameter
num

It will send a response in json format, for example sending 6, this will be the result obtained
{"result":8}

As an improvement, you could add a different way of sending parameters either by console, or be able to add more parameters and return an array or json with the results
